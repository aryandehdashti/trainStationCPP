# trainStationCPP
My first experience of programing

This was my first experience of programing and the goal was writing a train station program with CPP without using OOP and database.
I know it's full of non sense codes but I can not look at it as a project that I want to improve it or be proud of it.
It's more than a first year project to me. It's start of my journy.
